# What is Hidden Curriculum?

## Hidden Curriculum:

* Anything useful to research, but never taught
* Time saving - work smarter, not harder
* Reproducible

## Main Topics:

* File Organization
  - Research projects are huge tasks 
  - Time consuming
  - Likely to forget what you did along the way

# Your Future Self:


### Make your future-self happy:
  * Your future-self is lazy.
  * Your future-self is forgetful.
      - Key decisions? 
      - Anomalies in the data?


### Your future-self does not want to:

* Figure out which order to run files
* Understand what each line of code does
* Look for files across different systems
* Input new results if the data changes



  
---
# File Organization:

## How Should I Organize My Files?

* An unfamiliar person should be able to:
  - Understand your structure
  - Know where the data is
  - Know how the data was created
  - Know which files determine which results
  - Reproduce the results exactly

## Important Methods:

* Folders - large tasks/smaller tasks
* Naming Convention - Be consistent!
* README 
* Version Control (beyond this course)

# Organizing with Folders

.center[[** SEE EXAMPLE **](https://github.com/michaeltopper1/Fraternities)]

### Personal Preferred Structure:

* analysis_data
* created_data
* raw_data
* figures
* tables
* code
* presentations
* paper
* literature_review

#### <font color="blue">**You can use any structure, but keep it simple!**</font>

# File Naming

# File Naming: 

### Naming Needs to Be:

* Machine Readable 
  - Sometimes, spaces matter (Linux/Mac vs. Windows)
* Human Readable
  - Understand your own file quickly
* Default Ordering (less important)
  - Your files work well with the default ordering scheme


### Typical Naming Conventions:

* snake_case (preferred!)
  - Spaces are underscores
  - All text is lowercase
* camelCase (also good!)
  - No spaces
  - Separate words by CapitalLetters

---
# Examples:

## snake_case:

* Cleaning raw Data -> clean_raw_data

* Table 1 analysis -> table_1_analysis

## CamelCase:

* Cleaning raw Data -> CleaningRawData

* Table 1 analysis -> Table1Analysis

---
# Human Readable:

The more information you give in the title, the easier it will be for your future-self and others.

.pull-left[
### Less Clear:
### snake_case: 

* Cleaning raw Data -> clean_raw_data
  - Which data?
* Table 1 analysis -> table_1_analysis
  - I don't know what Table 1 does.
  - Would need to open file
]

.pull-right[
### More Clear:
### snake_case: 
* Clean NLSY 1996 Cohort -> clean_nlsy_1996_cohort
* Table 1 Main Results Regressions -> table_1_main_results_regressions

# README
---
# README

### Definition:

A special file that gives a "run-down" of the other files in the folder.

### Elements: 

* .txt file (so anyone can open this)
* One in every folder with multiple files 
* Describes the main purpose of each file/folder contained
* Clear - everyone should know what files do what after reading
* Update these frequently:
  - Hard to do, realistically, before you take a long break from the project.

# Coding Files

---
# Coding Files:

### Coding Files (Surface)
* Number when ordering needed
* Make informative file names (as discussed)

### Coding Files (Within)
* Use comments to explain code to readers
* Make informative names!!!!!!
  - Bad: r1 
  - Good: regression_income_race_1
* Use Whitespace Effectively
* Keep files short (~100-150 lines)
  - One task per-coding file

---
# Coding: Bad

```{r, eval = F}
x=1
y=2
if(x!=y){
  print("They are not equal")
}else{print("They are equal")}
```


* No whitespaces: hard on the eyes
* No comments: time-consuming to read
* Uninformative naming of variables

---
# Coding: Good

```{r, eval = F}
## Defining Variables
first_number = 1 
second_number  = 2

## Checking if numbers are equivalent
if (first_number == second_number) {
  print("They are equal")
}
else{
  print("They are not equal")
}
```

# Assignment: Redo a Project

### Make an Old Project Reproducile

* Take an old project and use the tools we talked about to make it easy for an outsider to understand.
  - Rename, restructure
  - READMEs
* If you do not have one of these, create a pseudo-file structure for your current project with some fake files.
