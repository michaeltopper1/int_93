# Results 

## Decisions to make:

* What empirical results to report
* How many empirical results to report
* Which results go in the main body of the paper
* How to describe the results

**Best to present only results that directly bolster your main takeaway**

# Results Writing:

## Methods of writing:

* Plan out your attack
  - Remember: think about the story you want to tell
  - Results should flow logically
  - Think about what the next question a reader would ask, and then continue to that result next
* OUTLINE
  - Do this again and again and again
  - Your first outline will likely need it's logic reordered
* Please, do not write without an outline
    - Your paper will be BAD

# Example of Writing:

 > Table 1 shows that including a measure of ability in the wage equation lowers the
predicted effect of education on earnings. In Column (1), we do not include the
proxy measures of ability; the results reported in the Column indicate that a year
of education raises wages by 9.1 percent. In Column (2), we add the proxy
measures of ability, and the education effect drops to 3.1 percent. Columns (3) and
(4) report the results from the same specifications with the inclusion of state fixed
effects; the pattern of the results reported in these columns was that this general
pattern is consistent with the results from Columns (1) and (2). The estimates in
Table 1 are consistent with the hypothesis that an upward ability bias plagues the
na√Øve OLS estimates.

# Style:

## Results writing:

* Establish the main point in the topic sentence
* The first and last sentences should be "big picture"
    - They help tell the story
* Pay close attention to the story you are telling
  - Grind the story into the reader
* Remember to refer to columns as Column (1), Column (2) etc. 
  - Writing will help guide tables
* Good Example:
  - [Hanging out with the Usual Suspects](https://kschnepel.github.io/files/UsualSuspects.pdf) (Billings and Schnepel)

  - Only focus on the central results and takeaways
* Discuss potential mechanisms driving the results
* Potential policy implications
  - What did you learn about human behavior more generally?
  - What did you learn that we did not know before?
* Promising directions for future research
* Important limitations in your work
